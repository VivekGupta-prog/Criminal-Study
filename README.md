# Criminal-Study

A web app developed using MERN Stack. It provides organized details of the criminal activities to the public user about the crime scenes happened in a particular geographical area. A new algorithm for encryption-decryption developed for the security of this platform, which is based on OTP. It also has a ML model trained using the random forest algorithm for providing the output about a case whether that criminal would be arrested or not.

Technology Used: MERN Stack, Python, ML, Cryptography

The project was build under the College minor proect program and the major contributors were -
